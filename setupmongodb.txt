                                        listening to a dedicated port (27016 by
                                        default) to serve routing requests.
  --maintenanceMode arg                 Allows this node to skip starting up

                                        and  sharding components. This allows
                                        for performing maintenance on this
                                        node. To skip  setting up just sharding

                                        aSet. To skip setting  up both sharding
                                        and replication components use
                                        --maintenanceMode=standalone.

                                        with missing data files, allowing
                                        database renames, skipping oplog
                                        entries for collections not restored
                                        and more.
